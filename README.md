# About the project

Numbers are everywhere and play an important role in society! In this JavaScript counter project a value is shown on the custom HTML page and this value will increase by 1 when we click on the " + " button and decrease by 1 when we click on the " â€“ " button.

This second project as a full stack development student was indeed fun to build.
